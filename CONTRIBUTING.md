## Issues

If you're submitting a bug, please include the environment (browser/node) and relevant environment version(s) that you have encountered the bug in.

## Pull Requests

*Important: if you are submitting a pull request that does not address an open issue in the issue tracker, it would be a very good idea to create an issue to discuss your proposed changes/additions before working on them.*

1. Fork the repo on GitHub.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
2. Create a topic branch and make your changes.
3.  Run `npm run ci` to test your code and compile it to trianglify.min.js.
4. Submit a pull request to merge your topic branch into `master`.
